## Hello world!


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
The obligatory "Hello world!" program. As you can see, it is very short in Python:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
print("Hello world!")
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
Hello world!

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
The string `"Hello world!"` is passed to the method `print()` which prints the given argument to the output stream.
This is normally the console. In this case, however, the output stream is redirected to this browser window (below the cell).


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="alert task">

**Task:**

1. Start the interactive python shell
2. Print your name to the console

</div>

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
## Comments


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
# This is a comment and it is not interpreted by the compiler.
```




{:.input_area}
```python
print("Hello world!") # This line of code prints the string "Hello world!". The part behind the hastag is a comment
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
Hello world!

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
## Variables & datatypes


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
In the following snippet, the string `"Hello world!"` is assigned to the variable `x` (using `=`).
This means, that the string object `"Hello world!"` is stored in the PC's working memory and that the variable `x` points to this string object.
`x` is then printed.


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = "Hello world!"
print(x)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
Hello world!

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Variables can also point to numbers:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 42
print(x)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
42

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
In Python, there are basically 2 types of numbers: Integers (3,4,5,...) and floats (3.1415, 7.904532, ...):


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 3.1415
print(type(x)) # The function "type()" returns the datatype of the variable that was passed to it
print(x)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
<class 'float'>
3.1415

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Floats can also be written in scientific notation:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 4.08E+10
print(x)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
40800000000.0

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Python automatically converts between these types, if necessary, so you don't have to worry too much about it (for now).
The differences between these datatypes will be explained in later sections.
Important to know, is that integers generally take much less memory space than floats (which gets critical as soon as we work with big data (satellite data))


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Variable assignments can be done "simultaneously" on more than one variable :


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x, y, z = 1, 4.78, "Geographie"
print(x,y,z)      # The function "print()" accepts multiple arguments and prints them out separated by a " " (blank space)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
1 4.78 Geographie

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Variables can also be assigned to each other. When one variable is assigned to another variable, that means that it points to the same space in memory.


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 42 # x points to the object 42 in memory
y = 10 # y points to the object 10 in memory

x = y  # x now also points to the object 10 in memory
print(x, y)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
10 10

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
When one variable is changed, other variables are not affected:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 42 # x points to the object 42 in memory
y = 10 # y points to the object 10 in memory

x = y  # x now also points to the object 10 in memory
y = 99 # y now points to the object 99 in memory, x is not affected
print(x, y)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
10 99

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Another simple datatype is the boolean datatype. It can only store two values: `True` and `False`. It is used reasonably, when a variable can only take two states, e.g. to model the state of a light switch (on and off).


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = True
print(x)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
True

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
**Naming conventions:** Variable names can consist of more than just one character. The following rules apply:

- They must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (`_`)
- Other characters can be letters, numbers or an underscore
- They are case sensitive
- You cannot use some reserved words as a variable name because Python uses them for other things (e.g. `def`, `str`, `print`, ...)
- Words are normally separated by an underscore


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
first_name = "Marie"
last_name = "Curie"

print(first_name,last_name)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
Marie Curie

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Now you know the basic datatypes of Python (string, int, float, bool). There are more complex datatypes which will be covered later.


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="alert task">

**Task:**

1. Create two variables called `Vorname` and  `Nachname` and assign your first/last name to them as strings.
2. Create another variable called `Lieblingszahl` and assign it your favourite number.

</div>

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
## Arithmetic operators


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Most statements (logical lines) that you write will contain expressions. A simple example of an expression is `5 + 9`. An expression can be broken down into operators and operands.

In Python, you can use four basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. There are many more operators, which will be covered later.

Operators perform a specific computation. They require data to operate on. Such data is called operands, in this case, `5` and `9` are the operands.


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
5 + 9 # This is an expression. It's return value is the result of the expression (=14 in this case)
```





{:.output .output_data_text}
```
14
```




{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
You can also use `+` between strings, which just appends the first to the second:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
a = "Py"
b = "thon"

a+b
```





{:.output .output_data_text}
```
'Python'
```




{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Normally expressions are assigned to variables:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
meine_lieblingszahl = 9 - 5 + 4 - 10 * 4 / 8 + 39
meine_lieblingszahl
```





{:.output .output_data_text}
```
42.0
```




{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
You can also use brackets:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = (4 + 5) * 2
print(x)

x = 4 + 5 * 2
print(x)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
18
14

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Of course, you can also use variables within expressions:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
a = 4
b = 3
y = a * (b + 12)
print(y)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
60

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
And you can use one variable on the left- and righthand side of an expression. The right side gets evaluated (as always) and the result is written to the variable on the left side (as always):


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 10
x = x + 5
print(x)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
15

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="alert task">

**Task:**

1. Let Python calculate the sum of 44 and 124 and divide the result by 76 (all in one line). What is your result?
2. Let Python calculate the product of 0.3 and 3. Is the result what you expected?

</div>

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
## Logical operators


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
There are also logical operators, like `and`, `or` and `not`. (Again, there are some more operators but we will not cover all of them)

- `and` returns `True`, if the left and right operands both result in `True`, otherwise `False`
- `or` returns `True`, if either the left or the right operand results in `True`, otherwise `False`
- `not` returns `True`, if the right operand results in `Flase`, otherwise `True`


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
sun_is_shining = True
my_friends_are_here = True

i_am_happy = sun_is_shining and my_friends_are_here
print(i_am_happy)

my_friends_are_here = False
i_am_happy = sun_is_shining and my_friends_are_here
print(i_am_happy)
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
True
False

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Another operator is the double `==`. It is used to compare two variables and it returns `True`, if both variables have the same value, otherwise `False`:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 4
y = 3

x == y
```





{:.output .output_data_text}
```
False
```




{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="alert task">

**Task:**

1. What is the result of the following expressions? (Try to get the correct results before checking with Python)
    - `False and False`
    - `True and False`
    - `True or False`
    - `not True`
    - `not True and False or True`
2. Why does the following code block return `False`?

</div>

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
a = 1.8
b = 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6

a == b
```





{:.output .output_data_text}
```
False
```

## Formatted printing


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}



{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
Often, you want to print stuff to the console in a specific format. For example, you are not interested in the 10th decimal of a floating point number when you are calculating with euros and cents. For that, you can use formatted printing:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 321.14159265359
y = 5678

print(x)                      # prints the raw value 3.14159265359
print("{0:1.2f}".format(x))   # prints x as floating point number with min. 1 digit printed in total and max. 2 digits after the "."
print("{0:10.2f}".format(x))  # prints x as floating point number with min. 10 digits printed in total and max. 2 digits after the ".". Leading zeros are not shown, only blanks.
print("{0:15d}".format(y))    # prints y as integer with min. 15 digits printed in total. Leading zeros are not shown, only blanks.
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
321.14159265359
321.14
    321.14
           5678

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

    
You can also pass multiple arguments to the format-function.
The digit before the `:` references the index of the argument.
Only text within `{` and `}` is interpreted:


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}




{:.input_area}
```python
x = 10.25923457
y = 10
z = "milk"

print("{1:2d} liters of {2} cost: {0:10.2f}€.".format(x,y,z))
```


{:.output .output_stream}
```
10 liters of milk cost:      10.26€.

```


{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
